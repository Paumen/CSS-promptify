The Auditor identified PROMPT-KIT references in AUD-005 (5 locations) and AUD-008 (1 location in prompts/SYSTEM_PROMPT.md), but neither the Auditor nor the Engineer caught the reference in prompts/WORKFLOW.md. The Engineer fixed all explicitly identified locations but this one was not in the Auditor's list. After the Engineer's changes, this is now the ONLY remaining PROMPT-KIT reference in non-artifact documentation, creating an inconsistency.",

While the Engineer correctly fixed the PROMPT-KIT->prompts/ rename (AUD-001), the tree remains incomplete relative to the actual filesystem. This was not flagged by the Auditor as a separate finding (only the PROMPT-KIT mismatch was flagged as AUD-001 and the empty CSS-promptify/ was flagged as AUD-006), but the tree drift persists for these other items.",
